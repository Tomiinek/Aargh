- We will show you **[C] conversations** :speech_balloon: between a system and user.
- **Rank [N] system responses** based on how well they **fit to the particular dialogue context**
- Select **1** for **the best** and **[N]** for **the worst**.
- The context contains **past dialogue turns** and the **number of venues or trains complying** to the user constraints at the particular time.
- **Try to be as decisive as possible!** 
- If you **cannot decide** which continuation is more appealing, you **can rank more responses the same**.
- You are going to assess **delexicalized** responses which means that they **contain placeholders**.
- Placeholders are descriptive, for example, [name], [choice] or [bookday] which stand for the actual name of a venue, number of available options, or the day of booking, respectively.
